# Crypto-Clustering
The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning models, in this case KMeans to see how the various crypto coins clustered in their price volatility performance. We found that the coins clustered in four clearly separable formations. We also used Principle Component Analysis to compress our data from seven variables to three variables. When we compressed our data we found that the data clustered in almost exactly the same way across four clusters demonstrating our KMeans unsupervised model is effective.  The data source is a csv file detailing price fluctuation of multiple crypto coins over various time periods.
